# WikiTree
Random python program to map all connected wikipedia pages from an origin page. (Practicing API's, python, and GitHub stuff))
![Example](https://github.com/NolanGC/WikiTree/blob/master/WikiTree1.0.png "Example WikiTree")
Obscure origin page ensures a somewhat readable graph. Even depth two (origin -> children -> grandchildren) from a well-connected origin page results in too many nodes.
